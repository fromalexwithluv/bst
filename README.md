# The Challenge
Your company needs you to implement a Binary Search Tree (BST), using the language of your choice. Your solution will be utilized by several different teams throughout your organization. Initially, this BST only needs to support integers. 

## Requirements
* The BST must be built from an array of integers.
* Implement a method that returns the deepest nodes in the BST along with their depth.
* Implement any supporting methods needed for the solution to be useable by different teams throughout the organization.

## Example
	Input: {12, 11, 90, 82, 7, 9}
	Output: deepest, 9; depth, 3
